# Measurement-Converter-SwiftUI-

This was my first time building an app from scratch.

I did this as part of the 100 Days of UI and I have learned a lot in the process. I could apply my knowledge of Swift while also building an interface with Section, TextFiel, Picker, @State.

I hope my next projects. will be even bigger and better!
